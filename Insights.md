* Here protein distribution averages around 20g. Calories averages around 90 calories. Fats and Carbs average around 0g. We can see here that most foods that are considered high in protein have about 20g protein with less than 100 calories with close to 0g of carbs and fats.

* Here we check to see which foods have the best ratio of protein over calories. Most of the foods have 10 percent protein to calorie ratio. The top 5 best food with the most protein for calories are Tuna, Cod, Turkey Breast, Lobster, and Cuttlefish. The first Vegetarian and Vegan option were Seitan and Spirulina (dried) being 7th and 8th respectively.

* Protein did not differ much between diets but the Omnivorous diet had a higher protein content. Fats was surprising because the non-meat diets, Vegan and Vegetarian, had the most fats with most people I assume these diets would have less fats. This could probably be explained by removing the meats and the seafood food group that have 0 fats and the remaining food groups nuts and seeds most likely have a lot of fat. This is also probably the case with the carbs with a majority of the grains, nuts, and seeds being high carb. We will look further when we look in the food groups sections.

* Here we can see the 3 groups with the highest carbs are nuts, seeds, and grain and the three lowest are seafood, eggs, and meat. The three groups with the highest fats are nuts, seeds, and dairy, and the three lowest are vegan meat substitute, vegetables and legumes. The 3 highest Protein groups Meat, Seafood, and, Seeds with the lowest are fruits, grains, and legumes. In the Calories graph all of the food groups have equal calories except for Nuts and Seeds both being over 500 calories.

## General Recommendations
* If we want to focus primarily on losing weight we should look at food that is low in calories. Food groups such as Vegetables, Soy Products, and Vegan Products.

* In working out we usually want to hit a protein target in order to reduce the risk of losing muscle while on a diet. Individuals with these goals should focus on foods that are have the best protein to calorie ratio. 

* Those with Vegan and Vegetarian Diets may have a harder time hitting protein target due to the fact that a lot of their high protein foods have a lot of calories in them.
